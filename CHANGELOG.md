## 2.0-beta7 - 2022-01-19

### Fixed

- When translating an attribute, if we can't find a translation, we default to whatever the FieldType gives back instead of erroring.
- `TranslatedText` fieldtype now implements `JsonSerializable` interface ([#50](https://github.com/getcandy/getcandy/issues/50)).

### Changed

- Models that have channels now implement `start_at` and `end_at` columns. This replaces the previous `published_at` column.
- Laravel UI modal components removed.

### Added

- Added a new `default` column to the `tax_classes` table.
- Added `customer_id` to orders so an order has a 1:1 relation to a customer. ([#73](https://github.com/getcandy/getcandy/issues/73)).
- Created the `AttributeManifest` class so dev's can add their own attributable classes.
- Created the `FieldTypeManifest` class so dev's can add custom FieldTypes to the store.
- Added `$table->userForeignKey()` macro for migrations that create foreign keys which reference a user id.
